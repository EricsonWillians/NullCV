## üß± Preamble

The Cryptographic Commons License (CCL) exists to protect collective digital infrastructure from privatization, gatekeeping, and parasitic monetization.

Originally developed to support **NullCV**, this license empowers creators to **share without fear**, **verify without credentials**, and **build without permission**‚Äîensuring that the output of human labor remains *free, transparent, and owned by no one*.

This license is not just a legal framework. It is a **protocol for digital sovereignty**, and a declaration that our future belongs to builders‚Äînot brokers.
